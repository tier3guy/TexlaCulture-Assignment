# Expo App Starter Template

This is a simple starter template for building Expo apps. The template provides a basic project structure and a sample screen that renders a "Hello, World!" message.

## Usage

To use this starter template, simply clone the repository and install the dependencies by running the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/tier3guy/create-expo-app-starter-template
cd my-app
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

```
npm start
```

This will launch the Expo development server and open the Expo Developer Tools in your browser. From there, you can use your mobile device to scan the QR code and load the app in the Expo client app.

To build the standalone version of your app, run:

```
expo build:android
```

OR

```
expo build:ios
```

This will create a build directory with optimized and signed files that you can submit to the app stores.

## Features

- Basic project structure with a sample screen
- Integration with Node.js package manager (npm)
